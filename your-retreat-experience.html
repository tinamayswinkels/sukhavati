                    <p>Each and every Ayurvedic health tool has been designed
                    for those already with an idea of their mind-body type,
                    which is known as Dosha. Understanding your Dosha can help
                    you determine what foods, lifestyle choices and even body
                    shape are healthiest for your individual self. Knowing your
                    Dosha can help you cut through the maze of media spin when
                    it comes to information on the latest fad diets or healthy
                    eating practices. This can then enable you to make educated
                    judgements that lead to healthy weight loss based on your
                    mind-body type.<br /><br />Once you know your Dosha and have
                    adapted to living in a way that meets your biological needs
                    rather than disturbs them, you will arrive at the perfect
                    weight for you, naturally. Following a detailed consultation
                    with our Ayurvedic Doctor, you’ll learn the type of
                    mind-body you have and which foods best support it.</p>
