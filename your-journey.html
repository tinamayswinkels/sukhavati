                    Your first step is to select a retreat length that suits
                    your life and wellness needs. For a deep rest, recharge and
                    rejuvenative reset, 3-5 days is perfect. For a full
                    mind-body detox or cleanse we highly recommend 7-14 days.
                    And for a complete life or health transformation, you can
                    stay up to 21-28 days.

            class="sub-heading">SHORT RETREATS (3-6 days)</h3><p
            class="">For those with limited time, a 3–6 day stay offers
            a perfect introduction to the rejuvenating benefits of Sukhavati.
            Focused on relaxation and pampering, these shorter retreats allow
            you to enjoy our delicious vegetarian cuisine, soothing treatments,
            and the peaceful natural surroundings, leaving you feeling refreshed
            and renewed.</p><h3 class="sub-heading">MEDIUM RETREATS (1-2
            Weeks)</h3><p class="">A 7–14 day stay is ideal if you are
            seeking deeper rest and rejuvenation, and particularly if you are
            wanting to complete the traditional Ayurvedic Panchakarma process.
            This extended program includes a deeper level of purification,
            designed to remove deep-seated toxins, physical and emotional
            blockages and set the foundation for lasting wellness.</p><h3
            class="sub-heading">EXTENDED RETREATS (2-4 Weeks)</h3><p
            class="">If you're looking to promote healing or recovery
            from a chronic illness or have the desire to achieve and maintain
            the highest possible health you can, a 21-28 day stay can be
            life-changing. While most guests come for 5, 7 or 14 days (often
            once a year) and get incredible results, slightly longer stays are
            ideal where deeper imbalances or burnout needs to be resolved as
            well giving you plenty of time to fully and gently integrate all the
            profound transformation.</p>
