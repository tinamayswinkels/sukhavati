            <h2>A holistic approach to Detox.</h2><p>According to Ayurveda, true
            detoxification is much, much more than simply cleansing the
            body—it’s about purifying mind, body and spirit at the deepest level
            and creating a foundation for lasting health and vitality. With our
            Panchakarma detox process, combined with a personalised plan crafted
            during your consultation with our Ayurvedic doctors, you will
            eliminate deep-seated toxins and restore your body’s natural
            vitality and glow.</p><p>This transformative approach not only
            supports physical rejuvenation but also improves digestion, boosts
            energy, and enhances mental clarity. Guests frequently report
            feeling lighter, more energised, and deeply refreshed, with a
            renewed sense of wellbeing that lasts long after their stay. At
            Sukhavati, our comprehensive detox program is the first step in
            unlocking your body’s full potential for vibrant health.</p>
