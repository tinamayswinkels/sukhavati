            <h2 class="heading-lg">A holistic approach to long-lasting weight
            loss.</h2><h3 class="sub-heading">a Side Benefit - not the Main
            Goal</h3><p>At Sukhavati, we understand that many people come to
            health retreats specifically wanting to lose weight. In many cases
            (80-90%) our guests do lose weight. However, it is important to note
            that this is not the primary focus here.<br /><br />From the
            Ayurvedic perspective, the main goal is to help you achieve your
            optimal state of mental, physical, and emotional balance. When our
            bodies are in their optimal state of balance, they naturally detox
            on a daily basis, they are naturally resistant to stress and
            effortlessly maintain an ideal weight.<br /><br />According to their
            constitution and current state of balance or imbalance, some people
            do need to lose weight to achieve balance. Others do not. By
            focusing holistically and using the deeper wisdom of Ayurveda, we
            restore the doshas to balance. As a natural result, our health at
            every level improves.</p>

            <p><br /><br />Our focus at Sukhavati is on guiding you toward true
            balance and optimal health rather than solely focusing on specific
            outcomes like weight loss or temporary stress relief. <br /><br
            />Our timeless approach addresses the root cause of imbalances in
            the body and mind, allowing you to naturally return to your
            healthiest, most vibrant state. In this state of balance,
            unnecessary weight is shed, and stress is naturally dissolved. <br
            /><br />Other benefits include:<br /><br />- Feeling lighter and
            more energized<br />- Improved digestion and elimination<br />-
            Being the perfect weight for your body type<br />- Clearer, more
            radiant skin<br />- Deeper, more rejuvenative sleep<br />- Increased
            happiness and positivity<br />- Improved resilience to stress<br />-
            Better relationships, stemming from feeling better within
            yourself<br /></p>

                block-content-html: >-
                    <p>Each and every Ayurvedic health tool has been designed
                    for those already with an idea of their mind-body type,
                    which is known as Dosha. Understanding your Dosha can help
                    you determine what foods, lifestyle choices and even body
                    shape are healthiest for your individual self. Knowing your
                    Dosha can help you cut through the maze of media spin when
                    it comes to information on the latest fad diets or healthy
                    eating practices. This can then enable you to make educated
                    judgements that lead to healthy weight loss based on your
                    mind-body type.<br /><br />Once you know your Dosha and have
                    adapted to living in a way that meets your biological needs
                    rather than disturbs them, you will arrive at the perfect
                    weight for you, naturally. Following a detailed consultation
                    with our Ayurvedic Doctor, you’ll learn the type of
                    mind-body you have and which foods best support it.</p>

                button-text: Stimulate the metabolism
                block-content-html: >-
                    <p>The body’s metabolism is the primary fat burning function
                    and describes all the chemical processes that continuously
                    work inside your body. It’s the internal mechanism that
                    processes the food and drink products you consume and
                    converts them into energy. A fast metabolism can help a
                    person maintain a healthy weight, however a slower
                    metabolism can see a person struggle to lose body fat, and
                    in some cases even put more on. The key factors that slow
                    down a person’s metabolism, those being a sedentary
                    lifestyle and overeating, have the potential to block this
                    energy producing and fat burning system.</p><p>The
                    specialised treatments, herbal medicine, diet and activities
                    during our ayurvedic weight loss programs are designed to
                    powerfully regulate your metabolism to address weight issues
                    at the root cause.</p>

                block-content-html: >-
                    <p>There are different schools of thought relating to how
                    much movement or physical activity is necessary to partake
                    in on a daily basis. Some simply recommend getting in 30
                    minutes of intense physical activity, whether it’s walking
                    around the block, cycling on a stationary bike, or even
                    playing soccer in the park. Meanwhile, others simply make an
                    effort to walk or run 10,000 steps, maintaining a certain
                    level of intensity each day in order to increase
                    cardiovascular output, burn calories and break a
                    sweat.</p><p>Here at Sukhavati Ayurvedic Retreat &amp;
                    Wellness Spa, we provide 2 x one hour Yoga sessions each
                    day. You can also enjoy morning walks through the village at
                    sunrise, and bike rides daily.</p>
