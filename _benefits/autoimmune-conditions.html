            <h2>A holistic approach to long-lasting weight loss.</h2><h3
            class="sub-heading">a Side Benefit - not the Main Goal</h3><p>At
            Sukhavati, we understand that many people come to health retreats
            specifically wanting to lose weight. In many cases<br />(80-90%) our
            guests do lose weight. However, it is important to note that this is
            not the primary focus here.<br /><br />From the Ayurvedic
            perspective, the main goal is to help you achieve your optimal state
            of mental, physical, and emotional balance. When our bodies are in
            their optimal state of balance, they naturally detox on a daily
            basis, they are naturally resistant to stress and effortlessly
            maintain an ideal weight.<br /><br />According to their constitution
            and current state of balance or imbalance, some people do need to
            lose weight to achieve<br />balance. Others do not. By focusing
            holistically and using the deeper wisdom of Ayurveda, we restore the
            doshas to balance. As a natural result, our health at every level
            improves.</p>

            <p>Our focus at Sukhavati is on guiding you toward true balance and
            optimal health rather than solely focusing on specific outcomes like
            weight loss or temporary stress relief. <br /><br />Our timeless
            approach addresses the root cause of imbalances in the body and
            mind, allowing you to naturally return to your healthiest, most
            vibrant state. In this state of balance, unnecessary weight is shed,
            and stress is naturally dissolved. <br /><br />Other benefits
            include:</p><ul><li><p>Feeling lighter and more
            energized</p></li><li><p>Improved digestion and
