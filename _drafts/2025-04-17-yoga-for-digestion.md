## Digestive upset? Gas? Constipation? Bloating? These Yoga poses can help!

Not only will it relieve a wide range of symptoms, but will assist in managing digestive diseases and boost energy and vitality.

Whether you’ve eaten the wrong thing or too much, are feeling stressed or suffer something more severe like IBS or Chrons disease, we have all experienced digestive problems during our lives.

In the Ayurvedic and Yogic tradition, the state of our digestive system can create health and vitality, or be the root cause of disease. In this tradition, the metabolic energy of digestion is called Agni, and the key to health is to keep this burning strong. When this fire is burning strong, it breaks down dense physical matter into nutrients, vitamin etc. that the body and mind require to function. When it’s weak, it creates toxic build up, leading to disease.

An easy way to support digestive Agni and therefore create balance in the body and longevity is through Yoga.

## **How does Yoga help in Digestive Health?**

With a combination of deep breathing, twisting and stretching, the asanas (postures) support digestion in many ways.

The asanas coupled with conscious breathing and the emphasis of drawing the navel into the spine and expanding on the breath is like giving your internal organs a massage. This increases circulation and energy in our vital digestive organs such as the liver and pancreas. This aids in the release of the digestive enzymes such as hydrochloric acid, bile, pancreatic enzymes etc. which supports us in breaking down food efficiently, minimising reflux, bloating and wind.

Asanas support peristalsis (the movement of food through the digestive tract), creating good eliminations and encouraging the body to cleanse toxic materials from the tissues and cells that accumulate through weak digestion, wrong diet, and unhealthy lifestyle.

Yoga is also extremely beneficial in helping one of the main reasons for digestive issues in the first place which is: stress. The ancient yogis understood that excellent digestion is key to radiant health and sought to understand the mind-body connection. All of the tools practised in Yoga (asana, pranayama, meditation, etc.) together reduce the stress response of the body, rebalancing the autonomic nervous system. When we are constantly in a stressed or anxious state (a flight or flight response), your body is unable to relax and digest properly. Yoga soothes the sympathetic nerves system supporting us to move to a parasympathetic nervous system state which helps us to digest.

By practising the following yoga poses, you’ll get everything flowing in harmony again on the level of the mind, and body, so you can move through life with a happy belly.

## **Yoga poses that Support Digestion**

The following yoga practice incorporates poses like forward folds, which help massage and stimulate the internal organs; twists, which support the detoxification pathways of the body; conscious breathing, which helps boost circulation and supports digestion too.

Hold each post for 10 deep breaths or up to a minute if it feels good. Breathe deeply through the poses.

You can practice these poses daily to manage chronic digestive issues, or use them after a meal or whenever you have any gastrointestinal symptoms like gas, cramping, reflux, bloating to find relief.
