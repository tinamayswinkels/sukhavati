            <h2>A holistic approach to long-lasting weight loss.</h2><h3
            class="sub-heading">a Side Benefit - not the Main Goal</h3><p>At
            Sukhavati, we understand that many people come to health retreats
            specifically wanting to lose weight. In many cases<br />(80-90%) our
            guests do lose weight. However, it is important to note that this is
            not the primary focus here.<br /><br />From the Ayurvedic
            perspective, the main goal is to help you achieve your optimal state
            of mental, physical, and emotional balance. When our bodies are in
            their optimal state of balance, they naturally detox on a daily
            basis, they are naturally resistant to stress and effortlessly
            maintain an ideal weight.<br /><br />According to their constitution
            and current state of balance or imbalance, some people do need to
            lose weight to achieve<br />balance. Others do not. By focusing
            holistically and using the deeper wisdom of Ayurveda, we restore the
            doshas to balance. As a natural result, our health at every level
            improves.</p>

            <p>Our focus at Sukhavati is on guiding you toward true balance and
            optimal health rather than solely focusing on specific outcomes like
            weight loss or temporary stress relief. <br /><br />Our timeless
            approach addresses the root cause of imbalances in the body and
            mind, allowing you to naturally return to your healthiest, most
            vibrant state. In this state of balance, unnecessary weight is shed,
            and stress is naturally dissolved. <br /><br />Other benefits
            include:</p><ul><li><p>Feeling lighter and more
            energized</p></li><li><p>Improved digestion and
            elimination</p></li><li><p>Being the perfect weight for your body
            type</p></li><li><p>Clearer, more radiant
            skin</p></li><li><p>Deeper, more rejuvenative
            sleep</p></li><li><p>Increased happiness and
            positivity</p></li><li><p>Improved resilience to
            stress</p></li><li><p>Better relationships, stemming from feeling

                button-text: Understand Your Body Type
                block-content-html: >-
                    <p>Each and every Ayurvedic health tool has been designed
                    for those already with an idea of their mind-body type,
                    which is known as Dosha. Understanding your Dosha can help
                    you determine what foods, lifestyle choices and even body
                    shape are healthiest for your individual self. Knowing your
                    Dosha can help you cut through the maze of media spin when
                    it comes to information on the latest fad diets or healthy
                    eating practices. This can then enable you to make educated
                    judgements that lead to healthy weight loss based on your
                    mind-body type.</p><p>Once you know your Dosha and have
                    adapted to living in a way that meets your biological needs
                    rather than disturbs them, you will arrive at the perfect
                    weight for you, naturally.</p><p>Following a detailed
                    consultation with our Ayurvedic Doctor, you’ll learn the
                    type of mind-body you have and which foods best support
                    it.</p><p>Eating in harmony with your Dosha will enable you
                    to eventually do away with unhealthy food cravings, meaning
                    that low energy and poor self-esteem will fade away.
                    Replacing these negatives will be a renewed sense of
                    enthusiasm, high increase in energy, and healthy emotional
                    wellbeing.</p>

                button-text: Stimulate the Metabolism
                block-content-html: >-
                    <p>The body’s metabolism is the primary fat burning function
                    and describes all the chemical processes that continuously
                    work inside your body. It’s the internal mechanism that
                    processes the food and drink products you consume and
                    converts them into energy. A fast metabolism can help a
                    person maintain a healthy weight, however a slower
                    metabolism can see a person struggle to lose body fat, and
                    in some cases even put more on. The key factors that slow
                    down a person’s metabolism, those being a sedentary
                    lifestyle and overeating, have the potential to block this
                    energy producing and fat burning system.</p><p>The
                    specialised treatments, herbal medicine, diet and activities
                    during our ayurvedic weight loss programs are designed to
                    powerfully regulate your metabolism to address weight issues
                    at the root cause.</p>

                block-content-html: >-
                    <p>There are different schools of thought relating to how
                    much movement or physical activity is necessary to partake
                    in on a daily basis. Some simply recommend getting in 30
                    minutes of intense physical activity, whether it’s walking
                    around the block, cycling on a stationary bike, or even
                    playing soccer in the park. Meanwhile, others simply make an
                    effort to walk or run 10,000 steps, maintaining a certain
                    level of intensity each day in order to increase
                    cardiovascular output, burn calories and break a
                    sweat.</p><p>Here at Sukhavati Ayurvedic Retreat &amp;
                    Wellness Spa, we provide 2 x one hour Yoga sessions each
                    day. You can also enjoy morning walks through the village at
                    sunrise, and bike rides daily.</p>

                    containing heavy, dense, cold and sweet ingredients such as
                    meat, wheat, soy, dairy, ice cream, refined sugar (biscuits,
                    cakes – basically anything refined and processed) and fried
