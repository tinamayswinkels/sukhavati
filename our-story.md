**Panchakarma**

&nbsp;

Panchakarma – what is it, how does it work, and why is it so powerful?

&nbsp;

Panchakarma, a cornerstone of Ayurvedic medicine, is a holistic detoxification and

rejuvenation therapy designed to purify and balance the body at the deepest cellular

level. Panchakarma has been practised for thousands of years and is rooted in

ancient Ayurvedic texts. These texts outline the principles and techniques of

panchakarma, emphasising its role in maintaining optimal health and preventing

disease by eliminating accumulated toxins and balancing the doshas (the bodies

governing principles of intelligence).

&nbsp;

At Sukhavati, we recommend a minimum of 7 - 10 days to complete a Panchakarma process.

<br>If you wish to come for a shorter period, it will still be greatly beneficial and gently detoxifying, and will be focused more on the rejuvenation process.

&nbsp;

<u>The holistic benefits of Panchakarma</u>

&nbsp;

Panchakarma offers a complete mind and body makeover with benefits ranging from

deeply detoxifying the body, powerfully boosting immune function, enhancing mental

and emotional wellbeing by removing ‘emotional toxins’, balancing digestion,

metabolism and therefore weight, as well as improving cellular health.

&nbsp;

Panchakarma also reduces stress hormones, balances the endocrine system,

strengthens the mind and nervous system, promotes mental clarity, and supports the

body’s ability to burn fat and self-cleanse once treatments have finished. It also improves the gut-brain axis and helps rebalance the gut microbiota.

<br>

<u>What’s involved?</u>

&nbsp;

Panchakarma comprises three main stages:

1. The first stage, *Purvakarma* (preparation procedures), involves preparatory practices to

loosen and mobilise toxins. This will begin at home before you arrive and on the first

day or two of your stay.

2. The second stage, *Panchakarma* (detox & cleansing
{: start="2"}

procedures), consists of the core detoxification procedures that eliminate the toxins

from the body.

3. The third stage, *Paschat Karma* (rejuvenation procedures), focuses
{: start="3"}

on restoring strength and promoting ongoing health.
