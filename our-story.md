            <p><strong>Panchakarma</strong></p><p>Panchakarma – what is it, how
            does it work, and why is it so powerful?</p><p>Panchakarma, a
            cornerstone of Ayurvedic medicine, is a holistic detoxification and
            rejuvenation therapy designed to purify and balance the body at the
            deepest cellular level. Panchakarma has been practised for thousands
            of years and is rooted in ancient Ayurvedic texts. These texts
            outline the principles and techniques of panchakarma, emphasising
            its role in maintaining optimal health and preventing disease by
            eliminating accumulated toxins and balancing the doshas (the bodies
            governing principles of intelligence).</p><p>At Sukhavati, we
            recommend a minimum of 7 - 10 days to complete a Panchakarma
            process.  </p><p>If you wish to come for a shorter period, it will
            still be greatly beneficial and gently detoxifying, and will be
            focused more on the rejuvenation process.</p>
