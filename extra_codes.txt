temp

1) are these links to new pages or to part way down a page. If the first then do we have designs/content for them? if not can we get some clarity on what its linking to?
2) done
3) did they give examples on how to mix them up. Are we talking a gender mix or a shorts/youtube mix? and then just these arrows or all slider arrows?
4) this feels like a you question.
5) there was no 5
6) added permalink fields to all pages except for education as Yudi is working on it.
7) which page?
8) done.
9) this one need much more details. are they asking us to add more links or to change them or to check them? whats the plan on footer links?
10) removed from pages and added to extra_codes.txt
11) I'm assuming are we talking a more full button on hover for the buttons in the grid view of the villas with pools and villas no pools pages right and not a different set of buttons
12) so they are seeing something here that im not. what is it you think we should change
13) which is the leaf in question?
14) bg or text?
15) have they given us access?
