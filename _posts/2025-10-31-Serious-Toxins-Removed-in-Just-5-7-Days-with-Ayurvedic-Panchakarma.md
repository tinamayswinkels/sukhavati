Imagine removing over 50% of the most toxic chemicals from your body in just 5–7 days. In this video, Mark Bunn, Head of Education at Sukhavati, outlines how a landmark study by Dr. John Fagan and Dr. Robert Herron at the wonderful and award-winning Raj Panchakarma facility in the U.S. proved it’s possible — using Ayurvedic Panchakarma.

Unlike conventional detox methods that mainly target water-soluble toxins, Panchakarma can help eliminate fat-soluble toxins like:
- Organochloride pesticides (e.g. DDT)
- Heavy metals
- Environmental pollutants
- and potentially ... “Forever chemicals” found in carpets, cookware, cosmetics, and modern furnishings

These harmful compounds usually stay in the body for decades — some with a half-life of up to 50 years. 

In this video, we explore:

- The science behind Panchakarma detox
- How ingesting and digesting natural fats helps extract deep-seated toxins
- Its potential for removing modern “forever chemicals”
- Why Ayurvedic detox may be more relevant today than ever
