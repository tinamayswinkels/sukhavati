# What to Expect from a Liver Detox Retreat at Sukhavati

Curious about what actually happens on a liver detox retreat? At Sukhavati, we don’t believe in crash cleanses or one-size-fits-all solutions. Our Ayurvedic detox programs are designed to be personalised, nourishing, and deeply restorative—supporting not just your liver, but your whole system: body, mind, and spirit.

### Your Journey Begins with a Consultation

Every guest at Sukhavati starts with a one-on-one consultation with our Ayurvedic doctor. This isn’t a surface-level intake form—we look at your health history, digestion, energy levels, emotional patterns, and doshic constitution to design a program that meets you where you are.

Your retreat could be 3–5 days for rest and rejuvenation, 7–14 days for a full Panchakarma detox, or up to 28 days for deep healing and transformation. Explore our retreat lengths and [wellness goals](/your-retreat-experience.html).

### A Personalised Detox Plan

Based on your consultation, your liver detox plan may include:

* **Panchakarma therapies** such as medicated ghee, herbal massage, and gentle cleansing
* **Detox-supporting meals**: Light, vegetarian, seasonal dishes tailored to your needs
* **Herbal formulas** to support liver function and digestion
* **Daily yoga and meditation** to calm the nervous system and aid emotional detox
* **Nature immersion**: rice paddy walks, garden tours, river views and fresh air

Want to know more about these therapies? See our post on [Panchakarma and Liver Health: Detox at a Deep Cellular Level.](https://able-javelin.cloudvent.net/panchakarma-and-liver-health-detox-at-a-deep-cellular-level)

### Safe, Supervised, and Deeply Nourishing

Unlike many detox programs that rely on supplements or extreme fasting, our retreats are designed to be deeply nourishing. All therapies are supervised by medical professionals, ensuring your safety and comfort throughout. Our team includes internationally trained doctors like Dr. Komang Sudarmi and Dr. Dwija Permana, who guide every guest with care and expertise.

This is particularly important if you’ve ever tried a DIY cleanse or supplement-based detox and experienced side effects.

### A Day in the Life

Your daily rhythm is designed to support healing without overwhelm:

* Morning rice paddy walks and yoga
* Delicious Ayurvedic meals prepared by our chefs
* Personalised treatments and therapies
* Guided and silent meditations
* Restorative free time to lounge, journal or read
* Evening yoga, mocktails and dinner with fellow guests

See the full daily schedule and retreat inclusions.

### Post-Retreat Integration

You’ll also receive personalised wellness strategies to take home, helping you maintain the benefits of your detox long after your stay. From diet and lifestyle tips to herbal support, we make sure you leave with the knowledge and confidence to continue your healing journey.
