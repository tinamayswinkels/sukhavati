## Learn to Meditate at Sukhavati

Here at Sukhavati, we are pleased to provide the opportunity to learn the wonderful, health-promoting benefits of meditation during your stay. We offer a few different practices to cater for one’s individual preferences.

These include;

#### Transcendental Meditation

<br>Transcendental Meditation or TM has been the go-to meditation technique for many of the world’s highest performers over several decades. The likes of Hugh Jackman, Katy Perry, Jerry Seinfeld, Arianna Huffington, Ellen DeGeneres, and Ray Dalio, have practised the technique for decades and public promote it as one of the key reasons for their sustained success.

*“Meditation Has Changed My Life.*” Hugh Jackman

More recently, the likes of Tim Ferris, Oprah Winfrey, and many of the world’s top athletes, artists and business people have also learnt.

A simple, effortless technique that anyone can do, TM is taught over 4 consecutive days (about 60-90 minutes a day) and can be learnt at Sukhavati in conjunction with any treatment program.
