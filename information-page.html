            class="">Dating back over 6000 years, Ayurveda or Ayurvedic
            Medicine is recognised by the World Health Organisation as the
            world’s oldest continuous system of natural health care. ‘Veda’,
            means pure knowledge or science, and ‘Ayus’ means life or lifespan.
            Thus, Ayurveda is understood as ‘a complete knowledge or science of
            life’.</p>

            intelligence that governs our individual mind and body.<br /><br

            earth. Ayurveda allows us to gain greater control over our mind,

The doshas are the governing principles of intelligence for everything in the universe . . . including you! The doshas, and the combination of them, is what forms the foundation of our unique physical, mental and emotional characteristics. In Ayurveda, the first step to achieving optimal health is knowing who we are. What is our unique mix of the principles that govern everything from digestion to elimination to focus to weight gain, energy production, and sleep?</p><p class=\"\"><br />\LVata, Pitta &amp; Kapha:</p><p class=\"\"><br />The three doshas are known as Vata, Pitta, &amp; Kapha. Vata relates to air &amp; space. Pitta to fire and water, and Kapha to earth and water. By understanding these three doshas and how to influence them, you hold the reins of life in your hands. As the doshas govern everything, if we know how to balance them, we can go a long way to eliminating ill-health, creating mind-body balance and enjoying sustainable good health.</p>"

                block-content-html: >-
                    <p>Rather than a science of experimentation or research,
                    Ayurveda is what’s known as a ‘cognised’ science. Highly
                    enlightened ancient sages known as rishis (‘seers’ of
                    reality) through attaining higher states of consciousness
                    were able to witness through direct experience the
                    fundamental laws of nature that govern all of life. Over
                    6000 years ago, this wisdom was given to the world in what's
                    known as the Ayurvedic texts. Today, to experience the
                    benefits of Ayurveda, we need to go beyond the books, and
                    apply and live the wisdom.</p>

                block-content-html: >-
                    <p>No. Every retreat has their own individual focuses. At
                    Sukhavati, our unique approach is in making Ayurveda simple,
                    practical and easily applicable for everyone. This is
                    especially true for those who have never heard of Ayurveda
                    before or only know a little about it. We pride ourselves on
                    helping people transform their health even without knowing a
                    lot about Ayurvedic medicine. Of course, for those who are
                    keen to learn more, we provide a range of seminars, classes,
                    doctor guidance, take-home written material and ongoing
                    social media education to provide lifelong learning. The
                    main thing about our approach here at Sukhavati, is to be
                    flexible to what you most need.</p>

                block-content-html: >-
                    <p>Yes, Ayurveda can benefit everyone. Like any time-tested
                    wisdom however, it needs to applied properly for optimal
                    results. At Sukhavati, our skilled Ayurvedic doctors ensure
                    that each program is carefully customized to meet your
                    unique needs, guiding you through therapies that are safe,
                    balanced, and highly effective. This individualized approach
                    allows Ayurveda to work harmoniously with your body,
                    promoting healing, rejuvenation, and overall wellness, no
                    matter your age, lifestyle, or health background.</p>

                button-text: 'Is Ayuveda safe? '
                block-content-html: >-
                    <p>Yes, Ayurveda is completely safe when practiced as it was
                    traditionally prescribed. At the core of Ayurvedic wisdom is
                    that most of the benefits come from realigning our diet,
                    exercise, sleep and daily routine with the natural cycles of
                    life – there can’t be anything safer than that. The only
                    issue with the safety of Ayurveda has been some recent media
                    reports showing high levels of heavy metals in certain
                    Ayurvedic herbal preparations. This however is indicative of
                    unscrupulous or negligent manufacturing procedures, not
                    authentic Ayurvedic herbs. In addition, all Sukhavati herbs
                    are made under the guidance of our head Ayurvedic doctor –
                    Doctor Komang – and use locally sourced plants. Nature's
                    medicines, when properly sourced and used are by far the
                    safest medicines of all.</p>

                    Everything at Sukhavati is about reducing stress and helping
                    you achieve a state of deep relaxation and mental clarity.
                    As with the Ayurvedic approach to weight loss however, we
                    don’t focus on stress management perse. Our goal always is
                    to help you achieve your optimal state of mental, physical,
                    and emotional balance. When our bodies are in their optimal
                    state of balance, stress dissolves away, we naturally detox
                    on a daily basis, and are naturally resistant to stress.

                    Through our luxurious Ayurvedic treatments, calming yoga
                    sessions, the possibility of learning to meditate, and a
                    serene natural environment, we address the root causes of
                    stress. By the end of your stay, you’ll feel more resilient,
                    balanced, and ready to take on life’s challenges.

                    Our detox program or traditional Ayurvedic panchakarma
                    program, usually requires a minimum 7 day stay, and focuses
                    on a deep cleansing and purification of accumulated toxins.
                    The unique ability of Ayurvedic detox (panchakarma) to
                    remove toxins from fat tissue – think heavy metals,
                    pesticides and environmental pollutants – as opposed to just
                    water-soluble toxins like most modern-day cleanses (even
                    colonics), makes it the most powerful, full-body detox there
                    is.

                    Together with restorative and strengthening post-procedures,
                    the end-result is a truly holistic detox that will have you
                    feeling completely new.
