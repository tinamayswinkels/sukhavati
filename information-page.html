            class="p-subtle">Dating back over 6000 years, Ayurveda or Ayurvedic
            Medicine is recognised by the World Health Organisation as the
            world’s oldest continuous system of natural health care. ‘Veda’,
            means pure knowledge or science, and ‘Ayus’ means life or lifespan.
            Thus, Ayurveda is understood as ‘a complete knowledge or science of
            life’.</p>

            class="p-subtle">Ayurveda is based on the knowledge of the
            fundamental ‘laws of nature’.<br /><br />A key wisdom is the
            infinite intelligence that governs the entire universe is the same
            intelligence that governs our individual mind and body.<br /><br
            />We humans are intimately connected to Mother Nature and are
            comprised of the same basic elements – space, air, fire, water and
            earth. Ayurveda allows us to gain greater control over our mind,
            body, health and happiness.</p>

        block-content-html: "<h2 class=\"heading-lg\">About Ayurveda</h2><p class=\"p-subtle\">The understanding of body-types - known as the doshas - are fundamental to the effectiveness of Ayurvedic treatments. <br /><br />Sukhavati’s Head of Ayurvedic Education, Mark Bunn explains: <br />\L“According to Ayurveda, each one of us is comprised of a unique mix of three mind-body principles known as ‘doshas’. The doshas are the governing principles of intelligence for everything in the universe . . . including you! The doshas, and the combination of them, is what forms the foundation of our unique physical, mental and emotional characteristics. In Ayurveda, the first step to achieving optimal health is knowing who we are. What is our unique mix of the principles that govern everything from digestion to elimination to focus to weight gain, energy production, and sleep?<br />\LVata, Pitta &amp; Kapha:<br />\LThe three doshas are known as Vata, Pitta, &amp; Kapha. Vata relates to air &amp; space. Pitta to fire and water, and Kapha to earth and water. By understanding these three doshas and how to influence them, you hold the reins of life in your hands. As the doshas govern everything, if we know how to balance them, we can go a long way to eliminating ill-health, creating mind-body balance and enjoying sustainable good health.</p>"

                    <p>Each and every Ayurvedic health tool has been designed
                    for those already with an idea of their mind-body type,
                    which is known as Dosha. Understanding your Dosha can help
                    you determine what foods, lifestyle choices and even body
                    shape are healthiest for your individual self. Knowing your
                    Dosha can help you cut through the maze of media spin when
                    it comes to information on the latest fad diets or healthy
                    eating practices. This can then enable you to make educated
                    judgements that lead to healthy weight loss based on your
                    mind-body type.<br /><br />Once you know your Dosha and have
                    adapted to living in a way that meets your biological needs
                    rather than disturbs them, you will arrive at the perfect
                    weight for you, naturally. Following a detailed consultation
                    with our Ayurvedic Doctor, you’ll learn the type of
                    mind-body you have and which foods best support it.</p>
