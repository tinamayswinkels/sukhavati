            loss.</h2><h3 class="sub-heading">a Side Benefit - not the Main
            Goal</h3><p class="p-subtle">At Sukhavati, we understand that many
            people come to health retreats specifically wanting to lose weight.
            In many cases<br />(80-90%) our guests do lose weight. However, it
            is important to note that this is not the primary focus here.<br
            /><br />From the Ayurvedic perspective, the main goal is to help you
            achieve your optimal state of mental, physical, and emotional
            balance. When our bodies are in their optimal state of balance, they
            naturally detox on a daily basis, they are naturally resistant to
            stress and effortlessly maintain an ideal weight.<br /><br
            />According to their constitution and current state of balance or
            imbalance, some people do need to lose weight to achieve<br
            />balance. Others do not. By focusing holistically and using the
            deeper wisdom of Ayurveda, we restore the doshas to balance. As a
            natural result, our health at every level improves.</p>

            <p class="p-subtle"><br /><br />Our focus at Sukhavati is on guiding
            you toward true balance and optimal health rather than solely
            focusing on specific outcomes like weight loss or temporary stress
            relief. <br /><br />Our timeless approach addresses the root cause
            of imbalances in the body and mind, allowing you to naturally return
            to your healthiest, most vibrant state. In this state of balance,
            unnecessary weight is shed, and stress is naturally dissolved. <br
            /><br />Other benefits include:<br /><br />- Feeling lighter and
            more energized<br />- Improved digestion and elimination<br />-
            Being the perfect weight for your body type<br />- Clearer, more
            radiant skin<br />- Deeper, more rejuvenative sleep<br />- Increased
            happiness and positivity<br />- Improved resilience to stress<br />-
            Better relationships, stemming from feeling better within
            yourself<br /></p>

                block-content-html: >-
                    <p>Each and every Ayurvedic health tool has been designed
                    for those already with an idea of their mind-body type,
                    which is known as Dosha. Understanding your Dosha can help
                    you determine what foods, lifestyle choices and even body
                    shape are healthiest for your individual self. Knowing your
                    Dosha can help you cut through the maze of media spin when
                    it comes to information on the latest fad diets or healthy
                    eating practices. This can then enable you to make educated
                    judgements that lead to healthy weight loss based on your
                    mind-body type.<br /><br />Once you know your Dosha and have
                    adapted to living in a way that meets your biological needs
                    rather than disturbs them, you will arrive at the perfect
                    weight for you, naturally. Following a detailed consultation
                    with our Ayurvedic Doctor, youâ€™ll learn the type of
                    mind-body you have and which foods best support it.</p>
