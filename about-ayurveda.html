            <h2 class="heading-lg">Roots of Ayurveda</h2><p class="">Dating back
            over 6000 years, Ayurveda or Ayurvedic Medicine is recognised by the
            World Health Organisation as the world’s oldest continuous system of
            natural health care. ‘Veda’, means pure knowledge or science, and
            ‘Ayus’ means life or lifespan. Thus, Ayurveda is understood as ‘a
            complete knowledge or science of life’.</p>

            <h2 class="heading-lg">Key Principles</h2><p class="">Ayurveda is
            based on the knowledge of the fundamental ‘laws of nature’.<br /><br
            />A key wisdom is the infinite intelligence that governs the entire
            universe is the same intelligence that governs our individual mind
            and body.<br /><br />We humans are intimately connected to Mother
            Nature and are comprised of the same basic elements – space, air,
            fire, water and earth. Ayurveda allows us to gain greater control
            over our mind, body, health and happiness.</p>

        block-content-html: "<h2 class=\"heading-lg\">Individualised Wellness</h2><p class=\"\">The understanding of body-types - known as the doshas - are fundamental to the effectiveness of Ayurvedic treatments. <br /><br />Sukhavati’s Head of Ayurvedic Education, Mark Bunn explains: </p><p class=\"\"><br />\L“According to Ayurveda, each one of us is comprised of a unique mix of three mind-body principles known as ‘doshas’. The doshas are the governing principles of intelligence for everything in the universe . . . including you! The doshas, and the combination of them, is what forms the foundation of our unique physical, mental and emotional characteristics. In Ayurveda, the first step to achieving optimal health is knowing who we are. What is our unique mix of the principles that govern everything from digestion to elimination to focus to weight gain, energy production, and sleep?</p><p class=\"\"><br />\LVata, Pitta &amp; Kapha:</p><p class=\"\"><br />The three doshas are known as Vata, Pitta, &amp; Kapha. Vata relates to air &amp; space. Pitta to fire and water, and Kapha to earth and water. By understanding these three doshas and how to influence them, you hold the reins of life in your hands. As the doshas govern everything, if we know how to balance them, we can go a long way to eliminating ill-health, creating mind-body balance and enjoying sustainable good health.</p>"

                block-content-html: >-
                    <p>Rather than a science of experimentation or research,
                    Ayurveda is what’s known as a ‘cognised’ science. Highly
                    enlightened ancient sages known as rishis (‘seers’ of
                    reality) through attaining higher states of consciousness
                    were able to witness through direct experience the
                    fundamental laws of nature that govern all of life. Over
                    6000 years ago, this wisdom was given to the world in what's
                    known as the Ayurvedic texts. Today, to experience the
                    benefits of Ayurveda, we need to go beyond the books, and
                    apply and live the wisdom.</p>

                button-text: 'Are all ayuvedic retreats the same? '
                block-content-html: >-
                    <p>No. Every retreat has their own individual focuses. At
                    Sukhavati, our unique approach is in making Ayurveda simple,
                    practical and easily applicable for everyone. This is
                    especially true for those who have never heard of Ayurveda
                    before or only know a little about it. We pride ourselves on
                    helping people transform their health even without knowing a
                    lot about Ayurvedic medicine. Of course, for those who are
                    keen to learn more, we provide a range of seminars, classes,
                    doctor guidance, take-home written material and ongoing
                    social media education to provide lifelong learning. The
                    main thing about our approach here at Sukhavati, is to be
                    flexible to what you most need.</p>

                button-text: 'Is Ayurveda good for everyone? '
                block-content-html: >-
                    <p>Yes, Ayurveda can benefit everyone. Like any time-tested
                    wisdom however, it needs to applied properly for optimal
                    results. At Sukhavati, our skilled Ayurvedic doctors ensure
                    that each program is carefully customized to meet your
                    unique needs, guiding you through therapies that are safe,
                    balanced, and highly effective. This individualized approach
                    allows Ayurveda to work harmoniously with your body,
                    promoting healing, rejuvenation, and overall wellness, no
                    matter your age, lifestyle, or health background.</p>

                button-text: 'Is Ayurveda safe? '
                block-content-html: >-
                    <p>Yes, Ayurveda is completely safe when practiced as it was
                    traditionally prescribed. At the core of Ayurvedic wisdom is
                    that most of the benefits come from realigning our diet,
                    exercise, sleep and daily routine with the natural cycles of
                    life – there can’t be anything safer than that. The only
                    issue with the safety of Ayurveda has been some recent media
                    reports showing high levels of heavy metals in certain
                    Ayurvedic herbal preparations. This however is indicative of
                    unscrupulous or negligent manufacturing procedures, not
                    authentic Ayurvedic herbs. In addition, all Sukhavati herbs
                    are made under the guidance of our head Ayurvedic doctor –
                    Doctor Komang – and use locally sourced plants. Nature's
                    medicines, when properly sourced and used are by far the
                    safest medicines of all.</p>
